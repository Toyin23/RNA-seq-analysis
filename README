Notes/comments about the RNA-Seq pipeline
(blawney@jimmy.harvard.edu)

This pipeline has the option of taking either FASTQ or BAM files as input 
and running a differential expression analysis.

To get the basic input arguments, run ./rnaseq_pipeline.sh without any arguments

More complete documentation is in the Bioinformatics Analysis Google Drive under Workflows.
